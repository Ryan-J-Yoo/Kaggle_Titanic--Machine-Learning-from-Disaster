# Kaggle_Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
 
Project Description:
This is a guided project to familiarize and practice data analytic process:

Data exploration: to find patterns in the data
Feature engineering: to create new features from those patterns or through pure experimentation
Feature selection: to select the best subset of our current set of features
Model selection/tuning: training a number of models with different hyperparameters to find the best performer.
The data set is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
